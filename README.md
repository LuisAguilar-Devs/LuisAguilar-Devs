## Hi there, my name is Luis and this is my profesional github profile!

Im a software engeneer graduate with over 3 years of experience in fullstack development, microservices, usage of open-source services and data manipulation scripts.
I have a love to do everything as good, clean and with a purpose rather than just for the sake of doing it.
This is where you may find all my proyects that I want to display as profesional rather than something more personal or unfinished proyects
If you are curious about my personal profile: github.com/PEPSHERO
